If you use transfer.it, these Additional Terms of Service apply in addition to MEGA&rsquo;s General Terms of Service above. One important consideration with transfer.it is that the files and folders that are uploaded and downloaded with a file sharing link (Content) are not zero-knowledge encrypted (i.e. transfer.it does not use user-controlled encryption). </p> <h3>Scope</h3> <ol class="section"> <li>Transfer.it constitutes a &ldquo;service&rdquo;, as defined in clause 1 of MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>. If there is any conflict between these Additional Terms of Service and MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>, these Additional Terms of Service apply.</li> <li>Transfer.it allows you to upload, share and receive Content. As between you and us, your Content belongs to you. Also, you retain all responsibility and liability for your Content which may be used or forwarded on by the people you send it to.</li> <li>Please make sure you review MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>. Clauses 6 - 16 and 60 - 72 of these General Terms of Service are not relevant to transfer.it and therefore do not apply but the remainder of the <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>, in particular clause 17 about what you must not do, clauses 19 - 33 about Intellectual Property and the Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability and Indemnity by you at clauses 45-58 apply to your use of transfer.it.</li> <li>To upload Content and create a file sharing link, you may chose to give us your email address so we can send you a delivery receipt, and if you want transfer.it to email the file sharing link, the email address(es) of the recipient(s). You can otherwise choose to share the file sharing link yourself. </li> <li>Transfer.it does not currently impose limits on the size of the Content you can share or the number of times it can be downloaded. However, we reserve the right to introduce limits on uploads or downloads from any file sharing link if necessary for operational reasons, including to maintain a high-quality experience for all users. No transfer limits apply at launch. We reserve the right to introduce limits in the future, including download restrictions for transfers by free users. These limits may be adjusted, suspended, or temporarily relaxed from time to time for promotional or operational reasons...</li> <li>Using transfer.it is (currently) free of charge although we will at some point in the future introduce paid plans to transfer.it. You do not have to register although you are able to create a Mega account <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.nz/register" target="_blank">here</a> if you wish. If you do so, please make sure you review the entirety of MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>. </li> </ol> <h3>Your Content</h3> <ol class="section"> <li>When you upload Content directly from your device to transfer.it, it is encrypted &rsquo;client side&rsquo;; before leaving your device. The encryption keys are securely shared with transfer.it and held by our dedicated secure custodial infrastructure to enable access and sharing functionality. Files remain encrypted at rest on our file servers and are decrypted &rsquo;on-the-fly&rsquo; only when your Content is accessed via the file sharing link. This approach ensures a strong baseline of security while allowing seamless usability and efficient sharing through transfer.it.</li> <li>When you upload Content directly from Mega to transfer.it, the encryption keys for that Content are securely shared with us and held by us, as described just above at clause 7.</li> </ol> <h3>Takedown and enforcement</h3> <ol class="section"> <li>MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/takedown" target="_blank">Takedown Guidance Policy</a> applies to your use of transfer.it. If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give copies of your Content to competent authorities.</li> <li>If MEGA becomes aware of any breach by you of the Terms, we reserve the right to close or suspend your MEGA account, if you have one, and take any further steps provided for in MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/takedown" target="_blank">Takedown Guidance Policy</a>, transfer.it&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and/or <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/terms" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>.</li> <li>For serious breaches of these Terms, we are entitled to remove any or all of your Content immediately without notice and to suspend or terminate your account (e.g. if you upload and/or share child sexual abuse material or other illegal or infringing material). We strive to provide great services but do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or that transfer.it will be bug free.</li> <li>We may, but are not obliged to, preserve your Content where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent law enforcement authority or other third party. In relation to the release of your Content to competent law enforcement authorities and third parties, see our <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/takedown" target="_blank">Takedown Guidance Policy</a>.</li> <li>If you allow others to use transfer.it under your account (if you have created one, including a Business Account), in addition to them accepting these Terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using transfer.it and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these Terms, including where you are the administrator of a Business Account or multi-user account.</li> <li>If we suspend or terminate your access to transfer.it because you have breached these Terms, or someone you have given access to transfer.it under your account, has breached these Terms, during the term of that suspension we may delete your Content immediately or deny you access to your Content but keep it for evidential purposes.</li> </ol> <h3>Your Content</h3> <ol class="section"> <li>If you need support with transfer.it, please email us at support@transfer.it.</li> <li>These Additional Terms of Service for transfer.it may be amended, superseded or revoked at any time in accordance with clause 4 of MEGA&rsquo;s <a class="clickurl link" href="https://mega.io/takedown" target="_blank">General Terms of Service</a>.</li> </ol> <h3>Privacy</h3> <ol class="section"> <li>Your Content is not end-to-end encrypted and may be Personal Data (as defined in the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR)).</li> <li>Before you use transfer.it, you must agree to transfer.it&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </section> </div>
