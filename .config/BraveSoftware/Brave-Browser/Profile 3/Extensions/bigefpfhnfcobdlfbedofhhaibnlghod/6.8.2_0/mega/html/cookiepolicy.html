<div class="bottom-page content scroll-block selectable-txt pricing-pg cookie-policy"> ((TOP)) <div class="main-pad-block cookie-policy"> <h1>Cookie Policy - mega.nz</h1> <p> This Cookie Policy applies to the cloud storage and other services available from MEGA at <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.nz" target="_blank">https://mega.nz</a> (our <span class="bold">Services</span>). For information on our cookie policy for our public website at <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.io" target="_blank">https://mega.io</a>, click <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.io/mega-io-cookie" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <p> MEGA uses localStorage and sessionStorage to store information in your device that is strictly necessary to provide our Services as well as to store information that helps us understand how you engage with our Services. </p> <h2> What is localStorage? </h2> <p> localStorage is a browser feature that enables storage of a small amount of data when you access a web page. It allows MEGA to store important information locally to enable you to use our Services. Data in localStorage doesn't expire but you can delete it. </p> <h2> What is sessionStorage? </h2> <p> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; your web browser will save a small amount of data when you use our Services. The difference is that the data is only temporary. It gets automatically deleted when you close your web browser. </p> <h2> Essential information </h2> <p> LocalStorage and sessionStorage store information that is essential to provide our Services; for example to: </p> <ul> <li>log you in and keep your account secure;</li> <li>cache data to reduce server requests and enhance speed;</li> <li>enable you to resume where you left off and not lose progress when you use our Services across several tabs in your web browser;</li> <li>enable you to take advantage of our referral programme and discount campaigns;</li> <li>alert you if you are nearing, have reached or are exceeding your storage or transfer limit; or</li> <li>set your presence status on MEGA Chat.</li> </ul> <p> Without that information, we would not be able to provide our Services to you. For this reason, we do not require your consent for your web browser to save that information via localStorage and sessionStorage. </p> <h2> Non-essential information </h2> <p> We also use data stored in localStorage to obtain information that helps us understand how you engage with our Services by sending us usage statistics. For example, this enables us to understand which features are most popular. We then use this information to improve our Services. </p> <p> The non-essential information is not strictly necessary for us to securely provide our Services. By default, it will be disabled and not collected. It will only be collected if you opt in via the Cookies banner or in the Cookie Settings <span class="cookiesdialog">here</span>. Not accepting this information means we will have less data available to make improvements. </p> <h2> Advertising cookies </h2> <p> Depending on your location and if you are a not on a Mega Pro plan, you may see ads on our Services. We use Google Ad Manager to show you those ads. We do not disclose any of the personal information we hold about you to Google. </p> <p> In order to show you ads, Google may collect or receive information about you via cookies, including to personalise ads, limit the number of times an ad is shown to you, mute ads you have chosen to stop seeing, and measure the effectiveness of ads. </p> <p> A cookie is a small data file on your device which records information about your browsing activities. If you do not want Google to use cookies to personalise the ads displayed on our Services, access your Cookie Settings <span class="cookiesdialog">here</span>, or via the menu in the right-hand side column on <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.nz" target="_blank">https://mega.nz</a> once you have logged in. </p> <p> To learn more about how Google Ad Manager uses cookies, click <a class="clickurl" href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2839090?hl=en&ref_topic=28145&sjid=16522313467426858071-AP" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <h2> Managing cookies </h2> <p> When you use our Services for the first time, or if we start using new non-essential cookies or other technology, you will be shown a brief message explaining what we use cookies for. You can accept or refuse the use of any non-essential cookies from this message. Your choice will be saved so that the next time you use our Services you will not see the same message again. You can always adjust the choice you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again <span class="cookiesdialog">here</span>, or from the menu in the right-hand side column on <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.nz" target="_blank">https://mega.nz</a> once you have logged in. </p> <p> For more information on how MEGA handles your personal information, please see our <a class="clickurl" href="https://mega.nz/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy and Data Policy</a>.
